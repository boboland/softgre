Description: Layer 2 over Dynamic Soft-GRE Tunnels
    Soft-GRE refers to stateless GRE tunneling, whereby the AP forwards GRE encapsulated traffic to the WLAN-GW, and the GW reflects back the encapsulation in the downstream traffic towards the AP. WLAN-GW does not require any per-AP end-point IP address configuration. The WLAN-GW learns the encapsulation as part of creating the subscriber state on processing the encapsulated control and data traffic. Following are some of the advantages of soft-GRE:
 .
 * Resources are only consumed on the WLAN-GW if there is one or more active subscriber on the AP. Merely broadcasting an SSID from an AP does not result in any state on the WLAN-GW.
 * No per-AP tunnel end-point configuration on WLAN-GW. This is important as the AP can get renumbered.
 * No control protocol to setup and maintain tunnel state on WLAN-GW. Soft-GRE tunnel termination is performed on dedicated IOMs with MS-ISAs (referred to as WLAN-GW IOM) Each slot requires two MS-ISAs dedicated for soft-GRE tunnel termination. MS-ISA provides tunnel encapsulation/de-capsulation, bandwidth shaping per tunnel (or per-tunnel per SSID), and anchor point for inter-AP mobility. The ESM function such as per-subscriber anti-spoofing (IP and MAC), filters, hierarchical policing, and lawful intercept are provided on the carrier IOM corresponding to the ISA where the subscriber is anchored.
 .
 Encapsulation
 .
    The GRE encapsulation is based on RFC 1701/2784, Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE), WLAN-GW will encapsulate according to RFC 1701 with all the flag fields set to 0, and no optional fields present. WLAN-GW is able to receive both encapsulation specified in RFC 1701 and RFC 2784, with all flag fields set to 0, and no optional fields present in the header.
